This is a short textbased and rng focused battle game. All you do is fight a random monster until one of you runs out of hp.

All commands are simple inputs such as 1, 2, 3.
Magic attack cannot miss like regular attacks. They also deal a flat amount of damage.
Normal attacks have randomized damage and have the possibility to miss. This includes the Monsters as well.

Monster HP is randomized but can never be higher than a specific number.
Monsters only have the ability to attack but if the Monster's HP is too high you can always Flee to encounter a different one. 
There is a chance fleeing won't succeed and you'll have to risk getting attacked for it.
Monsters also potentially drop Healthpots to recover HP. but they cannot drop Manapots.

The way to end the game is to either run out of HP or choose the "Exit Dungeon" option after defeating your opponent.
If you choose to leave the Dungeon normally the total amount of monsters slain is tallied and displayed.

Although there are different types of monsters they're only different in name, they all share the same health and attack damage pool.
There are no weaknesses because their HP pools vary greatly because of the RNG.

To run the game extract the zip and execute Main.java file in cmd or Eclipse to run the program.

I worked on this project by myself so I wanted to keep things simple, it is also easily expandable. 
Since I worked alone I made a few mistakes such as not making more methods to reduce clutter.
Overall I think I did well for a first try.
